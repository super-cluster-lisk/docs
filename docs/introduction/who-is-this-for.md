# Who Is This For?

SuperCluster is designed as a **general-purpose liquid saving primitive** for the DeFi ecosystem. 

It serves users and protocols that require:
- ✅ Stable principal (no market volatility)
- ✅ On-chain yield generation
- ✅ Full liquidity (no lock-ups)
- ✅ Composability across DeFi

If you hold stablecoins and want them to work for you without sacrificing access or taking on market risk, **SuperCluster is built for you.**

## Target User Segments

### 1. Individual Users (Retail)

**Profile**

- Hold stablecoins such as USDC
- Prefer capital preservation over high-risk speculation
- Seek passive, low-complexity yield
- Require immediate access to funds

**Problems They Face**

- 💤 Idle stablecoins in wallets generate no yield
- ⚠️ Volatile staking (ETH, BTC) introduces unacceptable market risk
- 🔒 Vault-based products lock funds with no liquidity
- 🤔 Manual yield strategies are too complex and time-consuming

**What SuperCluster Offers**

- ✅ Stablecoin-only exposure — No market volatility
- ✅ Automatic yield accrual — Passive income, no management needed
- ✅ No protocol-level lock-ups — Access liquidity anytime
- ✅ Liquid receipt tokens — Use sUSDC/wsUSDC across DeFi

**Concrete Example**

> **Sarah**, a retail investor with **$10,000 USDC**:
> - Deposits into SuperCluster
> - Receives 10,000 sUSDC
> - Earns ~5-7% APY from Morpho and Ionic lending
> - After 1 year: ~10,500 sUSDC (automatically rebased)
> - Can swap on DEX anytime or use as collateral in other protocols

**Primary Use Cases**

- Long-term stablecoin savings ("crypto savings account")
- Short-to-medium term capital parking between investments
- Passive yield generation without active management

### 2. DeFi Power Users

**Profile**

- Actively use multiple DeFi protocols
- Optimize capital efficiency across platforms
- Require composability and fast reallocation
- Comfortable with advanced strategies

**Problems They Face**

- 💸 Idle capital between strategy rotations loses opportunity
- 📉 Non-productive stable collateral (regular USDC earns nothing)
- 🔀 Fragmented yield management across multiple protocols
- ⏱️ Manual protocol interactions waste time

**What SuperCluster Offers**

- ✅ Yield-bearing stable assets — sUSDC/wsUSDC continue earning yield everywhere
- ✅ Dual-token system — Choose rebasing (sToken) or non-rebasing (wsToken)
- ✅ Immediate liquidity — Swap on DEX or transfer instantly
- ✅ Strategy abstraction — Pilot Strategy handles optimization automatically

**Concrete Example**

> **Alex**, a DeFi power user with **$50,000 USDC**:
> - Deposits into SuperCluster → receives 50,000 sUSDC
> - Wraps to wsUSDC for use as collateral on Aave
> - Borrows against wsUSDC to leverage into other positions
> - **Still earning yield on original deposit** while using it as collateral
> - Can unwrap and exit anytime for other opportunities

**Primary Use Cases**

- Yield layering (earn on collateral while borrowing)
- Capital staging between DeFi strategies
- Cross-protocol composable positions
- LP provision with yield-bearing tokens (wsUSDC/USDC pools)

### 3. Protocol Builders and Developers

**Profile**

- Build DeFi applications and financial primitives
- Require standardized, composable assets
- Want to offer yield without managing strategies
- Focus on product differentiation

**Problems**

- Users expect yield on deposited stablecoins
- Yield strategy management increases surface area
- Vault tokens are difficult to integrate
- Lack of liquid, productive collateral standards

**Value Proposition**

- Plug-and-play yield-bearing stablecoins
- ERC-20 compatible integration
- Protocol-agnostic design
- Reduced operational complexity

**Primary Use Cases**

- Yield-bearing collateral
- Product-native savings layers
- Capital-efficient user balances

### 4. DAOs and Treasury Managers

**Profile**

- Manage large stablecoin treasuries (often $1M+)
- Require transparency and liquidity
- Operate under governance constraints
- Optimize long-term sustainability

**Problems They Face**

- 💰 Idle treasury capital earns nothing (opportunity cost)
- 🔒 Locked yield strategies reduce operational flexibility
- ⚡ Need rapid access for grants, operations, and partnerships
- ⚠️ Single-protocol exposure creates concentrated risk

**What SuperCluster Offers**

- ✅ On-chain, auditable yield — All transactions visible and verifiable
- ✅ Liquid treasury positions — Access funds anytime without breaking strategies
- ✅ Diversified exposure — Funds allocated across Morpho and Ionic
- ✅ Governance-friendly — Compatible with multi-sig and DAO structures

**Concrete Example**

> **GreenDAO** with **$5M USDC treasury**:
> - Deposits $3M into SuperCluster (keeping $2M for immediate operations)
> - Receives 3M sUSDC earning ~5-7% APY
> - After 1 year: ~$3.18M in value
> - When grant funding needed: Swap sUSDC to USDC on DEX instantly
> - **No governance vote required for emergency liquidity access**

**Primary Use Cases**

- Treasury yield optimization without lock-ups
- Capital preservation between major investments
- Operational liquidity with passive income
- Diversified risk management across protocols

### 5. Liquidity Providers

**Profile**

- Provide liquidity to AMMs and DEXs
- Optimize fee and yield returns
- Prefer low impermanent loss exposure
- Understand DeFi mechanics

**Problems**

- Stable pools rely solely on trading fees
- Idle pool capital is non-productive
- Competitive LP environments compress margins

**Value Proposition**

- Yield-bearing stable assets in LP positions
- Additional yield without added volatility
- Improved capital efficiency for stable pools

**Primary Use Cases**

- wsUSDC / USDC stable pools
- Curve-style stable liquidity
- Fee + yield stacking strategies

### 6. Institutional and Professional Users

## User Journey Overview

### **Individual User Journey**

```
Acquire USDC → Deposit to SuperCluster → Receive sUSDC → 
Yield auto-accrues (rebase) → Withdraw or swap anytime
```

**Example:** Hold sUSDC in wallet, watch balance grow daily

---

### **DeFi Power User Journey**

```
Deposit USDC → Receive sUSDC → Wrap to wsUSDC → 
Use across DeFi protocols → Still earning yield → 
Unwrap or exit when needed
```

**Example:** Use wsUSDC as collateral while earning yield on deposit

---

### **DAO Treasury Journey**

```
Governance vote → Deposit treasury USDC → Receive sUSDC → 
Earn passive yield → Access liquidity via DEX when needed
```

**Example:** Earn on idle treasury without locking operational funds

---

### **Protocol Integration Journey**

```
Integrate wsUSDC standard → Accept as collateral or balance → 
Users deposit and earn yield automatically → 
Protocol benefits from yield-bearing assets
```

**Example:** Lending protocol accepts wsUSDC as collateral (more valuable than regular USDC)
