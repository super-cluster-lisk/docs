# Who Is This For?

SuperCluster is designed as a general-purpose liquid saving primitive for the DeFi ecosystem. It serves users and protocols that require stable principal, on-chain yield, liquidity, and composability without introducing market exposure.

## Target User Segments

### 1. Individual Users (Retail)

**Profile**

- Hold stablecoins such as USDC
- Prefer capital preservation
- Seek passive, low-complexity yield
- Require immediate access to funds

**Problems**

- Idle stablecoins generate no yield
- Volatile staking introduces unacceptable risk
- Vault-based products lock funds
- Manual yield strategies increase complexity

**Value Proposition**

- Stablecoin-only exposure
- Automatic yield accrual
- No protocol-level lock-ups
- Liquid receipt tokens usable across DeFi

**Primary Use Cases**

- Long-term stablecoin savings
- Short-to-medium term capital parking
- Yield generation without active management

### 2. DeFi Power Users

**Profile**

- Actively use multiple DeFi protocols
- Optimize capital efficiency
- Require composability and fast reallocation
- Comfortable with advanced strategies

**Problems**

- Idle capital between strategy rotations
- Non-productive stable collateral
- Fragmented yield management
- Manual protocol interactions

**Value Proposition**

- Yield-bearing stable assets
- Dual-token system for rebasing and non-rebasing needs
- Immediate liquidity via tokenization
- Strategy abstraction through Pilot Strategy

**Primary Use Cases**

- Yield layering (collateral + lending + LP)
- Capital staging between strategies
- Cross-protocol composable positions

### 3. Protocol Builders and Developers

**Profile**

- Build DeFi applications and financial primitives
- Require standardized, composable assets
- Want to offer yield without managing strategies
- Focus on product differentiation

**Problems**

- Users expect yield on deposited stablecoins
- Yield strategy management increases surface area
- Vault tokens are difficult to integrate
- Lack of liquid, productive collateral standards

**Value Proposition**

- Plug-and-play yield-bearing stablecoins
- ERC-20 compatible integration
- Protocol-agnostic design
- Reduced operational complexity

**Primary Use Cases**

- Yield-bearing collateral
- Product-native savings layers
- Capital-efficient user balances

### 4. DAOs and Treasury Managers

**Profile**

- Manage large stablecoin treasuries
- Require transparency and liquidity
- Operate under governance constraints
- Optimize long-term sustainability

**Problems**

- Idle treasury capital
- Locked yield strategies reduce flexibility
- Need rapid access for operations
- Single-protocol exposure risk

**Value Proposition**

- On-chain, auditable yield
- Liquid treasury positions
- Diversified exposure across lending markets
- Governance-friendly deployment

**Primary Use Cases**

- Treasury optimization
- Capital preservation between investments
- Operational liquidity with yield

### 5. Liquidity Providers

**Profile**

- Provide liquidity to AMMs and DEXs
- Optimize fee and yield returns
- Prefer low impermanent loss exposure
- Understand DeFi mechanics

**Problems**

- Stable pools rely solely on trading fees
- Idle pool capital is non-productive
- Competitive LP environments compress margins

**Value Proposition**

- Yield-bearing stable assets in LP positions
- Additional yield without added volatility
- Improved capital efficiency for stable pools

**Primary Use Cases**

- wsUSDC / USDC stable pools
- Curve-style stable liquidity
- Fee + yield stacking strategies

### 6. Institutional and Professional Users

**Profile**

- Funds, treasuries, family offices
- Require liquidity and capital efficiency
- Demand transparency and auditability
- Conservative risk tolerance

**Problems**

- Idle stablecoin balances
- Limited yield options without lock-ups
- Need diversified, conservative strategies
- Require verifiable on-chain reporting

**Value Proposition**

- Stablecoin-native yield
- Immediate liquidity
- Transparent accounting
- Modular risk exposure

**Primary Use Cases**

- Capital staging
- Treasury yield optimization
- Liquidity management during low market activity

## User Journey Overview

**Individual User**

Acquire USDC → Deposit → Receive sToken → Yield accrues → Withdraw or swap anytime

**DeFi Native User**

Deposit → sToken → Wrap to wsToken → Use across protocols → Unwrap or exit

**Protocol Integration**

Integrate wsToken → Accept as collateral or balance → Users earn yield by default

## User Priorities by Segment

| Segment        | Primary Priority    | Key Benefit            |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Retail Users   | Capital stability   | Simple yield           |
| Power Users    | Composability       | Capital efficiency     |
| Protocols      | Infrastructure      | Standardized yield     |
| DAOs           | Liquidity           | Transparent returns    |
| LPs            | Returns             | Yield stacking         |
| Institutions   | Security            | Conservative yield     |

## Not Intended For

SuperCluster may not be suitable for users who:

- Seek maximum APY regardless of risk
- Want exposure to volatile assets
- Require fixed or guaranteed interest rates
- Intend to hold funds for extremely short durations
- Are unwilling to interact with smart contracts

## Summary

SuperCluster is designed for users and protocols that require:

- Stable principal
- On-chain yield
- Full liquidity
- Cross-protocol composability

It functions as shared infrastructure, enabling both individuals and protocols to treat stablecoins as productive, liquid, and programmable assets.
