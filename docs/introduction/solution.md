# The Solution

## SuperCluster: Liquid Saving Protocol for Stablecoins

SuperCluster introduces a new DeFi primitive: a Liquid Saving Protocol.  
It applies the liquidity and composability principles of liquid staking to stablecoins, enabling yield generation without exposure to market volatility.

By focusing exclusively on stable assets, SuperCluster provides:

- Principal stability
- Sustainable yield
- Full liquidity
- Native composability across DeFi

## Design Principles

### 1. Principal Stability

**Objective:** Remove market risk from yield generation.

**Approach:**

- Accept only stablecoin deposits (e.g. USDC)
- No exposure to volatile assets
- Asset value remains anchored to the underlying stablecoin
- Yield represents net value increase, not price appreciation

As a result, users earn yield without needing to manage market cycles or price movements.

### 2. Consistent Yield

**Objective:** Generate sustainable returns without speculative incentives.

**Approach:**

- Allocate funds to established lending protocols
- Diversify exposure across multiple markets
- Optimize allocation based on risk-adjusted returns
- Avoid reliance on short-term token emissions

**Initial Yield Sources:**

| Protocol | Category              | Risk Profile |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| Morpho   | Optimized lending     | Low–Medium   |
| Ionic    | Decentralized lending | Low–Medium   |

Allocation decisions are handled by the **Pilot Strategy**, which balances yield, liquidity, and risk.

### 3. Full Liquidity

**Objective:** Maintain access and composability while earning yield.

**Approach:**

- Mint liquid receipt tokens for all deposits
- Tokens remain transferable and usable across DeFi
- No forced lock-ups at the protocol level

Users can access liquidity through:

- Secondary markets (DEX swaps)
- Native protocol withdrawals with deterministic redemption

## Protocol Flow

### Deposit and Yield Lifecycle

1. User deposits stablecoins
2. SuperCluster mints sToken at 1:1
3. Pilot Strategy allocates capital to lending protocols
4. Yield accrues from borrower activity
5. Protocol updates total assets
6. Rebase or exchange rate adjustment reflects yield

User ownership is represented entirely through tokens, not vault shares.

## Architecture Overview

User  
└─ Deposits stablecoins  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└─ Receives sToken / wsToken  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└─ SuperCluster Core  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├─ Mint / burn logic  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├─ Rebase & accounting  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└─ Wrapping mechanism  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└─ Pilot Strategy  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├─ Allocation logic  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└─ Risk controls  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└─ Yield Adapters  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└─ External Lending Protocols

This separation ensures modularity, upgradeability, and risk isolation.

## Dual-Token Model

### sToken (Rebasing)

- Balance increases as yield accrues
- Represents proportional ownership of total assets
- Suitable for direct holding and savings use cases

**Use case:** Users who prefer balance-based growth.

### wsToken (Non-Rebasing)

- Fixed balance
- Value increases via exchange rate
- Compatible with protocols that do not support rebasing tokens
- Fully convertible back to sToken

**Use case:** DeFi integrations, collateral, liquidity provision.

## Key Innovations

### Modular Adapter Layer

Each yield source is integrated through a dedicated adapter responsible for:

- Deposits and withdrawals
- Protocol-specific interactions
- Yield accounting

**Benefits:**

- Easy addition or removal of yield sources
- Reduced blast radius in case of issues
- Protocol-agnostic design

### Pilot Strategy Layer

The Pilot Strategy functions as a portfolio manager:

- Allocates capital across lending protocols
- Balances yield, liquidity, and risk
- Designed for future governance or automation upgrades

**Example Allocation Factors:**

| Factor          | Purpose                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Yield           | Return optimization     |
| Liquidity       | Withdrawal readiness    |
| Risk            | Exposure control        |
| Diversification | Systemic risk reduction |

### Rebase & Accounting Model

- sToken: supply rebases to reflect yield
- wsToken: supply remains constant, exchange rate increases
- Both represent the same underlying ownership

**Rebase Frequency:**

- Hackathon MVP: event-based
- Production target: automated daily rebase
