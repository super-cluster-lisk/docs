# The Solution

## SuperCluster: Liquid Saving Protocol for Stablecoins

SuperCluster introduces a new DeFi primitive: a **Liquid Saving Protocol**.  

**Think of it as "Lido for stablecoins"** — applying the liquidity and composability principles of liquid staking to stablecoins, but without the market volatility risk.

By focusing exclusively on stable assets and battle-tested lending protocols, SuperCluster provides:

- **Principal stability** — No volatile asset exposure
- **Sustainable yield** — Real returns from lending activity
- **Full liquidity** — Transferable, composable receipt tokens
- **Native composability** — Use across DeFi without restrictions

**SuperCluster eliminates the fundamental trade-off** between yield, liquidity, and composability.

## Design Principles

### 1. Principal Stability

**Objective:** Remove market risk from yield generation.

**Approach:**

- Accept only stablecoin deposits (e.g. USDC)
- No exposure to volatile assets
- Asset value remains anchored to the underlying stablecoin
- Yield represents net value increase, not price appreciation

As a result, users earn yield without needing to manage market cycles or price movements.

### 2. Consistent Yield

**Objective:** Generate sustainable returns without speculative incentives.

**Approach:**

- Allocate funds to established lending protocols
- Diversify exposure across multiple markets
- Optimize allocation based on risk-adjusted returns
- Avoid reliance on short-term token emissions

**Integrated Yield Sources (Lisk Hackathon Scope):**

| Protocol | Category              | Risk Profile | Purpose                    |
|----------|----------------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Morpho   | Optimized lending    | Low–Medium   | Primary yield generation   |
| Ionic    | Established lending  | Low          | Diversified exposure       |

Allocation decisions are handled by the **Pilot Strategy**, which balances yield, liquidity, and risk across these protocols.

*Additional protocols may be integrated in production deployments.*

### 3. Full Liquidity

**Objective:** Maintain access and composability while earning yield.

**Approach:**

- Mint liquid receipt tokens for all deposits
- Tokens remain fully transferable and usable across DeFi
- No forced lock-ups at the protocol level
- Dual-token system for maximum flexibility

Users can access liquidity through:

- **Instant liquidity:** DEX swaps (sUSDC/USDC or wsUSDC/USDC pairs)
- **Protocol withdrawal:** Two-step request-and-claim process with deterministic redemption

Unlike vaults that trap funds, SuperCluster's liquid tokens provide **immediate access** to value.

## Protocol Flow

### Deposit and Yield Lifecycle

1. User deposits stablecoins
2. SuperCluster mints sToken at 1:1
3. Pilot Strategy allocates capital to lending protocols
4. Yield accrues from borrower activity
5. Protocol updates total assets
6. Rebase or exchange rate adjustment reflects yield

User ownership is represented entirely through tokens, not vault shares.

```

**Key Benefits:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular and upgradeable design
- Easy integration of new yield sources
- Risk isolation between components

## Dual-Token Model

### sToken (Rebasing)

- Balance increases as yield accrues
- Represents proportional ownership of total assets
- Suitable for direct holding and savings use cases

**Use case:** Users who prefer balance-based growth.

### wsToken (Non-Rebasing)

- Fixed balance
- Value increases via exchange rate
- Compatible with protocols that do not support rebasing tokens
- Fully convertible back to sToken

**Use case:** DeFi integrations, collateral, liquidity provision.

## Key Innovations

### Modular Adapter Layer

Each yield source is integrated through a dedicated adapter responsible for:

- Deposits and withdrawals
- Protocol-specific interactions
- Yield accounting

**Benefits:**

- Easy addition or removal of yield sources
- Reduced blast radius in case of issues
- Protocol-agnostic design

### Pilot Strategy Layer

The Pilot Strategy functions as an intelligent portfolio manager that automatically optimizes capital allocation across lending protocols.

**Core Functions:**
- Allocates capital across Morpho and Ionic
- Balances yield, liquidity, and risk in real-time
- Dynamic rebalancing based on market conditions
- Designed for future governance or user-selectable strategies

**Strategy Examples** *(Flexible architecture supports multiple approaches)*

| Strategy Type              | Focus                           | Best For                      |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Conservative Yield        | Stable returns, lower risk      | Risk-averse users, treasuries |
| Moderate Balanced         | Balanced yield and safety       | Most users                    |
| Optimized Performance     | Maximum risk-adjusted returns   | Yield maximizers              |

**Allocation Factors:**

| Factor          | Purpose                     | Weight |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|--------|
| Yield (APY)     | Return optimization         | High   |
| Liquidity Depth | Withdrawal readiness        | High   |
| Risk Score      | Protocol safety             | Medium |
| Diversification | Systemic risk reduction     | Medium |

The Pilot Strategy continuously monitors these factors and rebalances when optimization thresholds are met (e.g., APY differential >2%).

### Rebase & Accounting Model

- sToken: supply rebases to reflect yield
- wsToken: supply remains constant, exchange rate increases
- Both represent the same underlying ownership

**Rebase Frequency:**

- Hackathon MVP: event-based
- Production target: automated daily rebase
