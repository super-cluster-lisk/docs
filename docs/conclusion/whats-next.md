# What’s Next?

This section outlines the near-term roadmap and forward-looking milestones for SuperCluster. The focus is on progressing from an MVP hackathon prototype into reliable, production-grade DeFi infrastructure.

---

## Short-Term Roadmap (Post-Hackathon)

### 1. MVP Hardening

The immediate priority after the hackathon is stabilizing the core protocol.

- Refine core accounting logic
- Improve deposit and withdrawal edge-case handling
- Harden receipt token mechanics (sUSDC / wsUSDC)
- Add protocol-level safeguards and invariant checks
- Improve documentation and developer tooling

Goal: ensure correctness, clarity, and predictable behavior under normal conditions.

---

### 2. Strategy Validation

Before expanding yield sources, existing strategies must be validated in real conditions.

- Run controlled pilots with capped TVL
- Monitor utilization, yield consistency, and latency
- Stress-test withdrawal paths during utilization spikes
- Validate adapter isolation and failure handling

Goal: prove that the yield abstraction model works reliably.

---

### 3. Security Review & Audits

Security is a gating factor for growth.

- Internal code reviews and threat modeling
- External audit preparation
- Incremental audits focusing on:
  - Core accounting
  - Strategy adapters
  - Upgrade paths

Goal: reduce systemic risk before scaling capital.

---

## Mid-Term Roadmap

### 4. Strategy Expansion

Once the initial system is stable, SuperCluster will expand yield sources.

- Add additional lending protocols and markets
- Introduce multiple Pilots with distinct risk profiles
- Enable strategy-level allocation controls
- Expose transparent performance metrics

Goal: improve yield resilience through diversification, not leverage.

---

### 5. DeFi Integrations

SuperCluster’s value increases with composability.

- Enable wsUSDC usage as collateral
- Support DEX liquidity pools
- Integrate with money markets and structured products
- Provide SDKs and integration guides for protocols

Goal: make SuperCluster assets first-class DeFi building blocks.

---

### 6. UX & Developer Experience Improvements

Accessibility and clarity are essential for adoption.

- Simplified deposit and withdrawal flows
- Clear yield and risk visualization
- Improved documentation and examples
- Developer-friendly interfaces for integration

Goal: reduce friction for both users and builders.

---

## Long-Term Direction

### 7. Progressive Decentralization

Governance evolves alongside protocol maturity.

- Introduce governance frameworks gradually
- Decentralize strategy approvals and parameters
- Community participation in risk and allocation decisions
- Transparent on-chain governance processes

Goal: align protocol control with its user base over time.

---

### 8. Multi-Chain Deployment

SuperCluster is designed to be chain-agnostic.

- Deploy on additional EVM-compatible networks
- Evaluate cross-chain liquidity abstraction
- Maintain consistent behavior across chains

Goal: serve users wherever stablecoin liquidity exists.

---

### 9. Becoming a DeFi Primitive

The long-term ambition is infrastructure, not an application.

- A standard receipt token model for savings
- A predictable yield abstraction layer
- A base component for treasuries, protocols, and applications

Goal: make “productive stablecoins” the default assumption in DeFi.

---

## Guiding Principle Going Forward

SuperCluster will prioritize:

- Security over speed
- Reliability over maximum APY
- Composability over closed optimization
- Long-term trust over short-term growth

---

## Summary

SuperCluster’s roadmap is intentionally incremental.

Each phase builds confidence, security, and composability before scaling capital. By advancing methodically, the protocol aims to evolve from a hackathon MVP into durable, ecosystem-level infrastructure for stablecoin savings.

What’s next is not just more features — it’s stronger foundations.
