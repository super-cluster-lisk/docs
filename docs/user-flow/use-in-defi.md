# Use in DeFi

One of SuperCluster's most powerful features is the **composability** of sUSDC and wsUSDC tokens. You can use these liquid saving tokens across DeFi protocols while continuously earning yield from SuperCluster.

**Key Benefit:** Double-dip yield strategies - earn SuperCluster base yield PLUS returns from other protocols.

## What is Composability?

**Composability** means your SuperCluster tokens can be freely used in other DeFi protocols as:

- Collateral for borrowing
- Liquidity in decentralized exchanges
- Assets in yield strategies
- Collateral in derivatives
- And more...

**All while maintaining your SuperCluster yield!**

## Token Compatibility Matrix

| DeFi Category         | sUSDC Compatible? | wsUSDC Compatible? | Recommended |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| **DEX Trading**       | Limited           | Full               | wsUSDC      |
| **Liquidity Pools**   | May have issues   | Full               | wsUSDC      |
| **Lending Platforms** | Not supported     | Full               | wsUSDC      |
| **Yield Aggregators** | Complex           | Full               | wsUSDC      |
| **Stablecoin Swaps**  | OK                | OK                 | Either      |
| **Simple Holding**    | Perfect           | OK                 | sUSDC       |
| **NFT Purchases**     | OK                | OK                 | Either      |

**General Rule:** Use **wsUSDC** for maximum DeFi compatibility.

## Use Case 1: Collateral for Borrowing

### Overview

Use wsUSDC as collateral to borrow other assets without selling your position.

### How It Works

```
1. You have: 10,000 wsUSDC (worth 10,500 USDC at 1.05 rate)
2. Deposit wsUSDC to Aave as collateral
3. Borrow: 6,000 USDC (60% LTV)
4. Your wsUSDC continues earning SuperCluster yield
5. As wsUSDC value increases, health factor improves
```

### Step-by-Step Example

**Initial State:**

```
You own: 10,000 sUSDC
Exchange rate: 1.05
Value: 10,500 USDC
```

**Step 1: Wrap to wsUSDC**

```
Wrap 10,000 sUSDC → Get 9,524 wsUSDC
Value: 9,524 × 1.05 = 10,000 USDC
```

**Step 2: Deposit to Aave**

```
Deposit: 9,524 wsUSDC
Collateral value: 10,500 USDC
Max borrow (60% LTV): 6,300 USDC
```

**Step 3: Borrow**

```
Borrow: 6,000 USDC
LTV: 57% (safe)
Health Factor: 1.75 (healthy)
```

**Step 4: Yield Continues**

```
After 1 year:
Exchange rate: 1.10 (5% SuperCluster yield)
wsUSDC value: 9,524 × 1.10 = 10,476 USDC

New LTV: 6,000 / 10,476 = 57.3%
Health Factor: Improved!
```

### Benefits

- **Maintain SuperCluster yield**
- **Borrow without selling**
- **Self-improving collateral** (value increases over time)
- **Capital efficiency**

### Risks

- **Liquidation risk** if borrowed asset appreciates significantly
- **Interest on borrowed amount**
- **Smart contract risk** from both protocols

## Use Case 2: Liquidity Provision

### Overview

Provide liquidity in DEX pools to earn trading fees while maintaining SuperCluster yield.

### Strategy: wsUSDC/USDC Pool

**Optimal Pair:** wsUSDC + USDC (correlated assets, low impermanent loss)

```
┌───────────────────────┐
│  Uniswap V3 Pool      │
│                       │
│  50% wsUSDC (5,000)   │
│  50% USDC (5,000)     │
│                       │
│  Your LP Position     │
└───────────────────────┘
         │
         v
  Triple Yield Source:
  1. SuperCluster yield on wsUSDC
  2. Trading fees from swaps
  3. Potential LP incentives
```

### Example Calculation

**Initial Position:**

```
Provide liquidity:
- 4,762 wsUSDC (worth 5,000 USDC at 1.05 rate)
- 5,000 USDC
- Total value: 10,000 USDC
```

**After 1 Year:**

```
SuperCluster yield: 5% APY
Trading fees: 2% APY
LP incentives: 3% APY

wsUSDC value: 4,762 × 1.05 = 5,000 → 5,250 USDC
Trading fees earned: ~200 USDC
LP incentives: ~300 USDC

Total value: ~10,750 USDC
Total APY: ~7.5%
```

## Use Case 3: Yield Aggregator Strategies

### Overview

Deposit wsUSDC into yield aggregators to stack multiple yield sources.

### Example: Yearn Finance Strategy

```
1. Deposit wsUSDC to Yearn Vault
2. Yearn deploys wsUSDC to optimized strategies
3. You earn:
   - SuperCluster base yield (5%)
   - Yearn strategy returns (3-5%)
   - Compounded automatically

Total APY: 8-10%
```

### Strategy Stacking

**Conservative Stack:**

```
Base: SuperCluster yield (5%)
 + Yearn optimization (2%)
 + Curve boost (1%)
------------------------
Total: ~8% APY
```

**Aggressive Stack:**

```
Base: SuperCluster yield (5%)
 + Leverage strategy (5%)
 + Incentive farming (3%)
------------------------
Total: ~13% APY (higher risk)
```

### Risk Warning

- **Complexity risk** - Multiple protocols = multiple failure points
- **Smart contract risk** - Each layer adds exposure
- **Yield sustainability** - Aggressive strategies may not be sustainable

## Use Case 4: Stable Swap Arbitrage

### Overview

Trade between wsUSDC and USDC to capture small price discrepancies.

### Arbitrage Opportunity

**Scenario:** wsUSDC trades below peg on DEX

```
Exchange rate: 1.05 (on SuperCluster)
DEX price: 1.04 USDC per wsUSDC

Arbitrage:
1. Buy wsUSDC on DEX for 1.04 USDC each
2. Unwrap to sUSDC
3. Withdraw or sell sUSDC for 1.05 USDC each
4. Profit: 0.01 USDC per wsUSDC (0.96% gain)
```

### Automated Arbitrage

**Bot Strategy:**

```
IF DEX_price < Exchange_rate * 0.99:
    Buy wsUSDC on DEX
    Unwrap to sUSDC
    Sell sUSDC
    Profit

ELSE IF DEX_price > Exchange_rate * 1.01:
    Buy sUSDC
    Wrap to wsUSDC
    Sell wsUSDC on DEX
    Profit
```

**Benefits:**

- Helps maintain peg
- Provides liquidity
- Risk-free profit opportunities

## Use Case 5: Cross-Chain Strategies

### Overview

Bridge wsUSDC to other chains for cross-chain yield opportunities.

### Future Multi-Chain Deployment

```

**Cross-Chain Use Cases:**

- Arbitrage between chains
- Access chain-specific protocols
- Optimize gas costs
- Diversify smart contract risk

## Use Case 6: Collateral for Derivatives

### Overview

Use wsUSDC as margin for perpetual futures or options.

### Perpetual Futures Example

```
Platform: GMX (if available on Lisk)

Deposit: 10,000 wsUSDC as margin
Leverage: 5x
Position: Long ETH

Benefits:
- wsUSDC continues earning SuperCluster yield
- Margin value increases over time (self-improving)
- Access leveraged positions
```

### Options Strategy

```
Sell Put Options:
- Collateral: wsUSDC
- Collect premium
- If exercised: Acquire asset at strike
- wsUSDC earns yield while waiting

Strategy: Generate income from both premium and yield
```

## Use Case 7: DAO Treasury Management

### Overview

DAOs can use SuperCluster for productive treasury management.

### DAO Strategy

**Traditional DAO Problem:**

```
DAO Treasury: 10M USDC sitting idle
Opportunity cost: Lost yield
Risk: Inflation erodes value
```

**SuperCluster Solution:**

```
1. Deposit: 10M USDC → 10M sUSDC/wsUSDC
2. Earn: 5% APY = 500K USDC/year
3. Use:
   - 50% wsUSDC as collateral for operations
   - 50% sUSDC as liquid reserve
4. Benefits:
   - Generate sustainable revenue
   - Maintain liquidity
   - Grow treasury automatically
```

### Multi-Strategy Treasury

```
DAO Treasury Allocation:
├─ 40% SuperCluster (base yield + liquidity)
├─ 30% wsUSDC in lending (additional yield)
├─ 20% wsUSDC/USDC LP (trading fees)
└─ 10% Reserve (immediate liquidity)

Expected combined APY: 7-9%
Annual revenue on 10M: 700-900K USDC
```

## Comparison: DeFi Usage vs Simple Holding

| Scenario            | Base APY | Additional Yield  | Total APY | Risk Level |
| ------------------- | -------- | ----------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **Hold sUSDC**      | 5%       | 0%                | 5%        | Low        |
| **Hold wsUSDC**     | 5%       | 0%                | 5%        | Low        |
| **Aave Collateral** | 5%       | -2% (borrow cost) | 3%        | Medium     |
| **Uniswap LP**      | 5%       | 2-4% (fees)       | 7-9%      | Medium     |
| **Yearn Vault**     | 5%       | 2-3%              | 7-8%      | Medium     |
| **Leveraged**       | 5%       | 3-5%              | 8-10%     | High       |
| **Recursive**       | 5%       | 5-7%              | 10-12%    | Very High  |
