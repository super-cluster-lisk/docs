# Protocol Overview

SuperCluster is a DeFi Liquid Saving Protocol built on Lisk Network that enables users to deposit stablecoins and earn sustainable yield while maintaining full liquidity. The protocol issues liquid receipt tokens that represent both the deposited principal and accumulated interest, allowing users to access their funds at any time without sacrificing yield generation.

Unlike traditional yield aggregators or vaults that lock capital, SuperCluster provides composable tokens that can be freely transferred, traded, or used as collateral across DeFi protocols while continuously accruing value.

The protocol focuses exclusively on stablecoins to eliminate market volatility risk and preserve principal value. Deposited assets are allocated across established lending protocols through an automated strategy layer, generating consistent returns without requiring user intervention.
