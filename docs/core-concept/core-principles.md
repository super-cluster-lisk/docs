# Core Principles

## Stable Principal

SuperCluster prioritizes capital preservation by operating exclusively with stablecoins. This eliminates exposure to volatile asset prices that can erode value faster than yield accumulates. Users can be confident that their deposited principal maintains its nominal value regardless of broader market conditions.

The protocol does not engage in leveraged strategies, derivative trading, or exposure to volatile assets. All yield is generated from established, audited lending protocols that provide stable, predictable returns on stablecoin deposits.

## Optimize Yield

The protocol continuously optimizes yield by allocating capital across multiple lending markets. An automated strategy layer evaluates available opportunities based on:

- Current APY rates across integrated protocols
- Available liquidity for withdrawals
- Risk parameters and protocol track records
- Diversification requirements

This optimization occurs without user intervention, ensuring capital is deployed efficiently while maintaining appropriate risk management and liquidity buffers.

## Full Liquidity

SuperCluster maintains full liquidity through its liquid receipt token model. Users are never locked into deposits and can access their funds through two primary methods:

1. **Protocol Withdrawal**<br/>
   Users can request withdrawal through the protocol's standard redemption process. The protocol prepares the underlying USDC from its lending positions and makes it available for claiming.

2. **DEX Exchange**<br/>
   Both sUSDC and wsUSDC can be traded on decentralized exchanges, providing instant liquidity at market-determined prices. This enables users to exit positions immediately without waiting for the protocol's withdrawal process.

The composable nature of receipt tokens means users can simultaneously earn yield while using their tokens as collateral, providing liquidity, or participating in other DeFi protocols.
