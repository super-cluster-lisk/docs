# How SuperCluster Works

SuperCluster is like a high-yield savings account for your stablecoins. You deposit USDC, receive liquid tokens that grow in value, and can access your funds anytime—all while your deposit earns consistent yield from established DeFi lending platforms.

## The Simple Journey

```
Deposit USDC → Receive sUSDC Tokens → Earn Yield Automatically → Withdraw Anytime
```

## What Happens When You Deposit

**You deposit USDC into SuperCluster**

- Connect your wallet and approve the amount
- Confirm the transaction
- Your USDC is deposited

**You receive sUSDC tokens immediately**
These tokens are your proof of ownership—like a digital savings receipt that has real value:

- Your balance grows automatically as you earn yield
- You can use them in other DeFi protocols while still earning
- They're always redeemable for your USDC plus accumulated returns

**Your funds start earning behind the scenes**
Instead of sitting idle, your USDC is distributed across trusted lending platforms (like Morpho and Aave) where borrowers pay interest. Think of it like a bank lending your deposit to reliable borrowers, except SuperCluster uses multiple platforms for better returns and safety.

```
Your USDC → SuperCluster → Split across Morpho & Aave → Borrowers pay interest → Yield returns to you
```

## Why This Works Better

**Stay Liquid**
Unlike vaults that lock your funds, sUSDC tokens can be:

- Sold instantly on decentralized exchanges
- Used as collateral in other protocols
- Transferred or traded freely

**Earn Consistently**
Your yield comes from real economic activity—people borrowing stablecoins and paying interest. No speculation or risky strategies.

**Protected by Diversification**
Funds are spread across multiple platforms. If one has lower returns or issues, others compensate and continue working normally.

## How You Earn Yield

The system automatically collects interest from lending platforms and updates your token value periodically. Your sUSDC balance increases without you doing anything.

**Example:**

```
Day 1:  1,000 sUSDC = 1,000 USDC
Day 30: 1,004 sUSDC = 1,004 USDC (earned 4 USDC)
Day 60: 1,008 sUSDC = 1,008 USDC (earned another 4 USDC)
```

## Accessing Your Funds

You have two withdrawal options:

**Through the Protocol** (Standard)

1. Request withdrawal with your tokens
2. System prepares funds from lending platforms (few hours to a day)
3. Claim your USDC plus all earned yield

**Via DEX Swap** (Instant)

1. Go to a decentralized exchange
2. Swap sUSDC for USDC instantly
3. Price follows market supply and demand

## Key Takeaways

- **Always yours** — Tokens represent full ownership of your deposit plus yield
- **Always liquid** — Access funds through protocol withdrawal or instant DEX swap
- **Always earning** — Yield from real borrowing activity, not speculation
- **Always diversified** — Multiple platforms protect against concentration risk
- **Always automatic** — System manages complexity, you just deposit and earn
