# How Your Funds Are Protected

DeFi savings come with risks. SuperCluster uses multiple safety measures to protect your funds while generating yield. This page explains what protections are in place and what happens if things go wrong.

## Our Security Philosophy

**Capital preservation comes first, yield second.**

SuperCluster prioritizes protecting your principal over chasing the highest returns. We'd rather earn you steady 5% safely than risky 10% with potential losses.

## Development Transparency

Some safety features are active now, others are being built for production launch:

- **Active Now** — Working in current version
- **In Development** — Coming before full launch
- **Future Plans** — Post-launch enhancements

This transparency helps you understand current protections versus planned improvements.

## How We Protect Your Funds

### 1. Platform Isolation

**What it means:** Each lending platform operates independently.

**Why it matters:** If one platform fails, others continue working normally.

**Example:** Your $10,000 is split across Morpho, Nusa, and Beefy. If Morpho has issues affecting $3,300, your funds in Nusa and Beefy remain safe. Maximum loss is 33%, not everything.

**Status:** Active now ✓

### 2. Diversification Limits

**What it means:** Funds are spread across multiple platforms, with limits on concentration.

**Planned rules:**

- Maximum 35% in any single platform (Morpho, Nusa, or Beefy)
- Minimum 3 different platforms used
- No over-concentration in one source

**Why it matters:** No single platform failure can wipe out your entire deposit.

**Status:** Basic version active; strict enforcement coming in production

### 3. Reserve Liquidity

**What it means:** Some funds stay readily available for withdrawals (target: 5-10% of total deposits).

**Why it matters:** You don't wait for funds to be recalled from lending platforms—most withdrawals process immediately from reserves.

**Status:** Basic version active; dynamic management coming in production

### 4. Automatic Monitoring

**What it means:** System watches for unusual activity like sudden rate changes, mass withdrawals from platforms, or unexpected balance drops across Morpho, Nusa, and Beefy.

**Why it matters:** Problems are caught early and addressed before becoming serious.

**Status:** Manual monitoring now; automated alerts coming in production

## The Risks You Should Know

**Platform Failure** — A lending platform (Morpho, Nusa, or Beefy) could be exploited or fail  
**Smart Contract Bugs** — SuperCluster's or partner protocols' code could have vulnerabilities  
**Liquidity Constraints** — High withdrawal demand might cause delays  
**Yield Volatility** — Returns can drop if borrowing demand falls

These risks exist in all DeFi. SuperCluster's protections reduce but don't eliminate them.

## What Happens If There's a Loss

Despite protections, losses can occur. Here's how they're handled:

### Loss Socialization

When a platform experiences losses, they're shared proportionally among all users—the standard DeFi model.

**Example scenario:**

- Total deposits: $1,000,000
- Morpho allocation: $333,333 (33%)
- Morpho loses 25% due to exploit
- Total loss: $83,333 (8.3% of all deposits)

**How it's distributed:**

| Your Deposit | Your Share | Your Loss | You Keep |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- | -------- |
| $100,000     | 10%        | $8,300    | $91,700  |
| $50,000      | 5%         | $4,150    | $45,850  |
| $10,000      | 1%         | $830      | $9,170   |

**Key points:**

- Everyone loses the same percentage
- No preferential treatment
- Transparent and verifiable

**Status:** Active now ✓

### Future: Insurance Fund

An insurance fund will cover losses before affecting users. It's built from protocol fees and grows over time.

**How it helps:**

- Total loss: $83,333
- Insurance covers: $50,000
- Users share: $33,333 (60% reduction in user impact)

**Target:** 1-5% of total deposits over time

**Status:** Planned for post-launch

## Emergency Response

If serious problems occur, SuperCluster follows clear steps:

**Immediate (1 hour)** — Problem identified, emergency measures activated, initial user notification  
**Active Response (2-24 hours)** — Regular updates, recovery actions, impact assessment  
**Resolution (1 week)** — Full incident report, preventive measures, compensation if applicable

All communication happens through official channels with complete transparency about what happened and what's being done.

## Your Role in Safety

**Understand the risks** — DeFi isn't risk-free; read and understand what you're using  
**Diversify your savings** — Don't put everything in one place, even SuperCluster  
**Stay informed** — Follow announcements and monitor your positions  
**Start small** — Test the system before depositing large amounts  
**Only risk what you can afford** — DeFi savings aren't like insured bank accounts

## Security Roadmap

**Current Phase:** Basic protections active, manual monitoring, internal security review  
**Production Launch:** Professional audits of Morpho, Nusa, and Beefy integrations, automated alerts, 24/7 monitoring  
**Post-Launch:** Insurance fund, bug bounty program, continuous improvements

## Honest Assessment

**What we do well:**

- Multiple protection layers across three major protocols
- Transparent about risks
- Fair loss handling
- Active monitoring of Morpho, Nusa, and Beefy

**What we cannot guarantee:**

- Zero risk of loss
- 100% uptime
- Constant yields
- Perfect protection from all scenarios

**The reality:** SuperCluster significantly reduces risk compared to managing funds yourself across multiple platforms, but DeFi always carries some risk. We minimize it through diversification across Morpho, Nusa, and Beefy, plus active management—we don't pretend it doesn't exist.

## Common Questions

**Can I lose all my money?**  
Technically yes, but highly unlikely. Morpho, Nusa, and Beefy would all need to fail completely and simultaneously. Diversification makes this scenario extremely rare.

**What's the most realistic risk?**  
A single platform experiencing issues causing 5-10% loss, shared proportionally among all users.

**How do I know SuperCluster is safe?**  
Professional security audits will be completed before production launch. Review the audit reports, start with small deposits, and monitor performance.

**What if I need money during a crisis?**  
You can swap tokens on a decentralized exchange for immediate exit, though prices might be lower during panic conditions.

**Who covers losses?**  
Currently, losses are shared among users proportionally. Future insurance fund will cover losses before they reach users.

**Can the team take my funds?**  
No. The protocol design prevents team withdrawals—operations are controlled by the system, not individuals.

## Summary

**Protections in place:**
Platform isolation (Morpho, Nusa, Beefy) • Diversification • Reserve liquidity • Active monitoring • Fair loss handling

**Our commitment:**
Honest risk communication • Transparent operations • Fair treatment • Continuous security improvements

**What you should know:**
DeFi has risks that can't be fully eliminated • SuperCluster reduces risk through design • Only deposit what you can afford to lose • Stay informed about your positions

SuperCluster's approach: minimize risk through diversification across three protocols and active management, handle problems fairly and transparently, continuously improve security.
